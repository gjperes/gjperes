My repositories are mainly college activities and projects, for learning purposes.

- 🔭 Currently I'm a employee at Vivo (Telefonica Brasil), as a Junior Software Developer.

- 📘 I’m currently learning the Microservices Architecture - using Spring, Angular, Nodejs and RabbitMQ, also, Android Development with Java.
