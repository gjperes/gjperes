- 🎉 I've concluded the alpha version of /todolist-ds122 with two colleagues
- 📘 I’m currently learning and improving my knowledge in JavaScript and Relational Databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- 🤔 I'm planning to learn the MERN stack, creating a few projects and better learning React & MongoDB (NoSQL), and Java
