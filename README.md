Most of my repositories are school activities or personal learning projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently improving my knowledge in Web Development and C Language.
- 🎉 I've concluded the alpha version of /todolist-ds122 with two colleagues. Hope to redo this project using the React and Laravel/Node in the future.
- 📘 Learning Java, React and Data Structures with C.
